Hey guys.

Please get all of your setups done ASAP.  If you need help figuring git out, let me know.  Otherwise, in order to use this repository, pull it into you local working environment, and move all the classes in the beans/ folder to your ~java-docs/beans/yourusername/ directory.  Then move the rest of the repository into your ~java-docs folder.

If you want to start working on some of the initial pages, please by my guest.

Andrew
