OneHitWonder's eSaint Auction System - CS331

I think this is probably a good way for us to organize our files.  If you want to start playing around with this repository, and creating some webpages, go for it by all means.

If you need help getting github setup, and how to use it, let me know.

Otherwise, there are tutorials out there that can show you everything you need to know.
